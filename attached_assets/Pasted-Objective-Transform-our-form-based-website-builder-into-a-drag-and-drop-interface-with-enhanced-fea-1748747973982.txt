Objective: Transform our form-based website builder into a drag-and-drop interface with enhanced features and functionality.

Context: Currently, Websites.co.in allows users to create websites by filling out forms, generating a website with customizable templates. We aim to upgrade this experience by introducing drag-and-drop functionality, providing users more control over their website design.

Key Features and Requirements:

User Experience:

Implement an intuitive drag-and-drop interface where users can drag and position elements like text, images, buttons, sections, columns, and navigation tools onto the canvas.
Ensure smooth interactions, including accurate mouse speed and behavior matching user actions.
Allow zoom in/out functionality using the mouse on the square canvas, providing adjustable view options.
Customization:

Retain the form-based approach for configuring element properties after they are placed on the canvas.
Users should be able to modify properties using forms once elements are positioned.
Homepage Design:

Create a homepage with options to start from templates or import projects.
If a user clicks “Start from Template,” provide template options and a blank canvas option.
Display saved projects with names and enable users to edit them later.
Builder Functionality:

Design a square canvas for users to drag and drop elements and tools.
Implement the left column with sections under “Basic,” “Layout,” and “Navigation Tools,” ensuring correct dragging and positioning behavior.
Dragging a section should create a new section on the canvas.
Dragging columns should position them within the section.
Same functionality for navigation tools.
Ensure the project gets saved correctly, displayed on the homepage with its saved name, and accessible for later editing.
Responsiveness:

Ensure the builder works seamlessly across different devices (mobile and desktop).
Scalability:

Design the architecture with future expansions in mind, accommodating more templates, elements, and features.
Code Quality:

Use React or another modern frontend framework for well-organized, readable code.
Deliverables:

Prototype of the drag-and-drop website builder.
A homepage that stores all saved projects and allows users to start from templates or import projects.
Builder page with a square canvas, zoom functionality, and accurate mouse behavior.
Functional left column elements for dragging and positioning on the canvas.
Proper saving and editing functionality for projects.
Brief documentation explaining the architecture, tools used, and rationale behind the approach.
A video demonstration of your work.
